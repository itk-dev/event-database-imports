ty Provider# User handling and login

Date: 28-09-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context
The idea is that each organization/institution have an appointed admin that is allowed to send user invitation out for his/her organization. Each user can be part of more than one organization, it just requires that they get an invitation and thereby link their account to a given organization. 

## Decision
For this first phase of the project users login by using username and password. If there needs to be a higher level of security sorounding user login in the future an identity Provider such as MitId can be connected to the project, but for now the customer has specifically requested (due to experiences with login in the existing solution) that we continue using username and password.
Using Single Sign On (SSO) would be a more professional login method for the future but for now it's not a part of the project.

## Consequences
Login using username and password is not as secure as using SSO
