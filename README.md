# Danish event database - 2.0

This is the next iteration of [the event database](https://github.com/itk-event-database/event-database-api) use by the
municipality of Aarhus.

The event database is a API platform for event aggregation from the public vendors throughout the cites. It gets data
mainly from feeds (JSON/XML) or APIs provided by the vendors. It is highly configurable in doing custom feed mappings
and extendable to read data from APIs and map this data to event. It also has a user interface to allow manual entering
of events.

The data input is pulled/pushed from a range of differently formatted sources and normalized into an event format that
can be used across platforms.

For more detailed and technical documentation see the docs folder in this repository.
